The Texas Holde'm Limit Poker consists of essentially two major components, which is the 1) Deck of Cards and it's evaluation and the 2) Betting Rounds that follow each communtity card reveal, ultimately ending with the show-down and the winner. Our project makes use of the "Deuces" module, whose Python 3 compatible version is "Treys", originally written for the MIT Pokerbots Competition. It is lightweight and extremely fast, used to effectively evaluate the hand strength. The poker betting round has been hard-coded for the different actions of Call, Raise, Check and Fold. Finally the Winner is the one amongst the players remaining on the table during the show-down with the strongest hand.
